Brief History of system dynamics</A>
</H1>

<P>
ystem dynamics programs express equations using a visual
metaphor. Before this metaphor was developed, anyone who wanted to
simulate a system or procedure had to write a computer program
(normally in
<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORTRAN">FORTRAN</A>). The
program might well replicate the system accurately, but only the
author of the program would know that—-everyone else had to take it on
faith, because the program code would be indecipherable to everyone
but the author.

<P>
For example, below is the Wikipedia’s example of a simple FORTRAN II
program to calculate the area of a triangle. Enjoy the ``My Eyes Glaze
Over'' effect of trying to understand what it does at your leisure.

A more complex problem would involve hundreds of pages of computer
code that no-one could understand (bar, one hoped, the person who
wrote it). <A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Forrester">Jay
Forrester</A>, an engineer
who had designed
<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlwind_(computer)">Whirlwind</A>(the
first computer with a video display for output), was confronted with
such a problem: working out for GE why a Kentucky appliance factory
had a regular three-year cycle in its employment. He developed a
diagrammatic representation of the manufacturing and hiring processes
at the factory, and showed that its internal hiring practices
generated the cycle.

<P>
System dynamics was thus born as a visual way of understanding a
complex system. With his background in developing computers that
produced visual output on a
<A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube">CRT</A>
(``cathode ray tube''; before Whirlwind-—and for some time after
it-—most computers printed their results on line printers), it was a
logical step for Forrester to move from hand-drawn diagrams to visual
representations of a complex model on a computer screen. 

<P>
The first such program had a hoot of a name: SIMPLE, which stood for
“Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations”
(it therefore qualifies for the annual COCOA award, given by the
<A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="https://www.acronymfinder.com/Committee-to-Outlaw-Contrived-and-Outrageous-Acronyms-(COCOA).html">Committee to Outlaw Contrived and Outrageous
Acronyms</A>). After
SIMPLE came
<A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DYNAMO_(programming_language)">DYNAMO</A>
(based on the slightly less outrageous acronym DYNAmic MOdels), and
ultimately the proliferation of modern commercial and Open Source
system dynamics programs. 

<P>
Now there are many programs--both commercial and Open Source--which
have built on the initial ideas in SIMPLE and DYNAMO, and they are the
workhorse tools of engineers all over the world. Here, for example, is
a simple model of a 4 cylinder car (one of the example files supplied
with Vissim). Real-world projects are substantially more complicated,
but this gives an idea of the complexity of tasks that can be
modelled, and the capability for breaking a complex system into
sub-units for design purposes.

Management, marketing and social science disciplines use a related
class of programs, like Stella. Here is a marketing model of customers
switching from one product to another:
