New to system dynamics?
</H2>

<P>
Minsky is one of a family of ``system dynamics'' computer
programs. These programs allow a dynamic model to be constructed, not
by writing mathematical equations or numerous lines of computer code,
but by laying out a model of a system in a flowchart, which can then
simulate the system. These programs are now the main tool used by
engineers to design complex products, ranging from small electrical
components right up to passenger jets.

<P>
Minsky adds another means to create the dynamic equations that are
needed to define monetary flows--the ``Godley Table''--which is
discussed in the next help topic for users who are experienced in
system dynamics. In this section, we'll give you a quick overview of
the generic system dynamics approach to building a model.

<P>
Though they differ in appearance, they all work the same way:
variables in a set of equations are linked by wires to mathematical
operators. What would otherwise be a long list of equations is
converted into a flowchart, and the flowchart makes the causal chain
in the equations explicit and visually obvious.

<P>
For example, say you wanted to define the rate of employment as
depending on output (GDP), labor productivity and population. Then you
could define a set of equations in a suitable program (like Mathcad):

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem.png"
 ALT="16">

</DIV>

<P>
Or you could define it in a flowchart, using a program like Vissim:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem1.png"
 ALT="19">

</DIV>

<P>
For a simple algebraic equation like this, modern computer algebra
programs like Mathcad are just as good as a flowchart program like
Vissim. But the visual metaphor excels when you want to describe a
complex causal chain.

<P>
These causal chains always involve a relationship between stocks and
flows. Economists normally model stocks and flows by adding an
increment to a stock in equations like this for the level of Capital,
where capital in year <IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$t$"> is shown as being capital in year <IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$t-1$"> plus
the investment that took place that year:

<P>
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
K_t=K_{t-1}+I_{t-1}
\end{displaymath}
 -->

<IMG
 WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="28" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
K_t=K_{t-1}+I_{t-1}
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
For reasons that are explained in the FAQ <A HREF="node60.html#faq:no-difference">``Why no difference
  equations?</A>, all stocks and flows in Minsky are
handled instead as integral equations. The amount of capital at time
<IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$t$"> is shown as the integral of net investment between time 0 and
today:

<P>
<BR><P></P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
K(t)=\int_0^t I(s)ds
\end{displaymath}
 -->

<IMG
 WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="46" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
K(t)=\int_0^t I(s)ds
\end{displaymath}">
</DIV>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">
<P></P>

<P>
However, rather than being shown as an equation, the relationship is shown as a flowchart:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem7.png"
 ALT="30">

</DIV>

<P>
The advantages of the flowchart representation of dynamic equations
over a list of equations are:

<UL>
<LI>They make the causal relationships in a complex model
  obvious. It takes a specialized mind to be able to see the causal
  relations in a large set of mathematical equations; the same
  equations laid out as flowcharts can be read by anyone who can read
  a flowchart--and that's most of us;
</LI>
<LI>The flowchart paradigm makes it possible to store components of
  a complex flowchart in a group. For example, the fuel delivery
  system in a car can be treated as one group, the engine as another,
  the exhaust as yet another. This reduces visual complexity and also
  makes it possible for different components of a complex model to be
  designed by different groups and then ``wired together'' at a later
  stage.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
For example, here's a model of a 4 cylinder engine car--one of the
simple examples distributed with the program Vissim:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="NewItem8.png"
 ALT="35">

</DIV>

<P>
Programs like Vissim and Simulink have been in existence for almost 2
decades, and they are now mature products that provide everything
their user-base of engineers want for modeling and analyzing complex
dynamic systems. <A HREF="node4.html#intro:experienced">So why has Minsky been
